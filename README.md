Depression severity can be classified into
 distinct phases based on the Beck depression inventory
 (BDI) test scores, a subjective questionnaire. However,
 quantitative assessment of depression may be attained
 through the examination and categorization of electroen
cephalography (EEG) signals. Spiking neural networks
 (SNNs), as the third generation of neural networks, incor
porate biologically realistic algorithms, making them ideal
 for mimicking internal brain activities while processing
 EEG signals. This study introduces a novel framework
 that for the first time, combines an SNN architecture
 and a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure to
 model the brainâ€™s underlying structures during different
 stages of depression and effectively classify individual
 depression levels using raw EEG signals. By employing
 a brain-inspired SNN model, our research provides fresh
 perspectives and advances knowledge of the neurological
 mechanisms underlying different levels of depression. The
 methodologyemployedinthisstudyincludestheutilization
 of the synaptic time dependent plasticity (STDP) learning
 rule within a 3-dimensional brain-template structured
 SNN model. Furthermore, it encompasses the tasks of
 classifying and predicting individual outcomes, visually
 representing the structural alterations in the brain linked
 to the anticipated outcomes, and offering interpretations
 of the findings. Notably, our method achieves exceptional
 accuracy in classification, with average rates of 98% and
 96% for eyes-closed and eyes-open states, respectively.
 These results significantly outperform state-of-the-art deep
 learning methods.
